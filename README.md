# Players for TheMovieDb-Helper Add-on

May 20 2025: 
- Removed players for dead add-ons and Redunant players from the Helper's bundled players.
- Added a POV Options player for Rescraping menu.

Most of these players I copied, some I have fixed. I have also added a few new players that were easy to create as mods of players for similar add-ons. You can ask for others and I will look into it, but not all add-ons are compatible with the Helper.

You can download the zip file or use the Helper settings and enter this URL:
