# TheMovieDb-Helper json Players

Players for TheMovieDb-Helper Add-on in Kodi 20 and 21 saved from the MrGSI repo.
I have added a couple new players that were easy to create but I have very little understanding how they work.

I have this list for my private build, but anyone can use it.
You can download the zip file or use the Helper settings and enter this URL:
